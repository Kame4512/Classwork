Amazing love everything This used “dot” works fine, compliments Echo. Works like new one. Can tell difference new one I bough refurbished one. Well I’m big fan echoes ones went I’m bathrooms. Works great expected 👍🏾 Purchased 83 year old mother-she loves talking Alexa! Very responsive-can detect “name” room. This like new -- performance brand new one; problems.

Very easy. Now I echo dot I command start playing music backyard deck sound system. Not substitute original. The echo dot performs well sound quality poor. To listen highest level 10. Love Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix apps Amazon Fire TV. No problems refurbished. Planning getting another one Amazon Fire Stick bedroom. Stopped working 7 months. The warranty good 3 months. I would assumed amazon product sold amazon would higher standards guaranteeing would work 3 whole months. I mean product supposed be, piece junk?They offered 15% discount I wanted buy another one. Why would I want buy another one? Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you. I like uncle. But sometime goes little Haywire Bought son didn’t work. He return it. Bought 2 quit connecting wifi responding voice within 9 months. Hard soft reset fix problem. I received Echo Dot today good condition, advised: I paid $29.99 Amazon (as writing) raised price $39.99, research buying get good deal!Set Dot went simple enough — plug in, follow app instructions... except initially took actually show iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, I dunno is, lately I’ve getting terrible support. The guy took call rambled (completely unhelpful) script I ended setting Dot middle spiel.I’m sure norm it’s refurbished, Dot pretty finicky wifi range randomly disconnects even though app shows range 5GHz connection strong. Reconnecting pain time well.All said, Alexa works, works amazingly well. I don’t speaker hooked it, one thing I really enjoy mic’s range sensitivity. One annoying limitations Apple’s Siri she’s playing audio device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), “Hey Siri” feature useless. Alexa problem hearing whatever playing time, amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried louder speakers yet, I’m sure continue hold true.Setting Alexa control wireless devices breeze, albeit limitations — support Arlo devices nil, special settings LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, knows change solid colors brightness levels.All all, rating would’ve lower I gotten decent price item. If connectivity problems persist, I may exchange/return item. I don’t want though — Alexa’s kind growing me. I bought everyone saying much love theirs. But I need it. I used once. The volume loud enough I played music I treadmill. So I rather use tower speaker 3xs louder. Worked like new. Will again. The second one refurbished model work-at least home. Very bad device, I don’t know it’s refurbished activated , nobody talking activated start talking. When talk yell super lauded Good new!! Just like brand new! Save money. Get one! Adding rooms convenience Nice. It works good.Some times easy recognize voice repeat several times, time almost screaming. I took chance certified refurbished unit $29. Looks brand new...no excuses disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity Alexa App iPhone flawless. Listening favorite tunes Bose Bluetooth setup happier. Walk door ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; viola... instant atmosphere! No opening iPad, going settings, turning bluetooth accessing Pandora app. It makes things effortless. A true joy right box! If I discover uses fine piece technology worth every penny! Alexa's sister (my second dot) Love Alexa Echo Dot - I two - one new, one refurbished. Both work great become go sooo many things. I love alarm every morning whenever. I love play music sounds ocean, nature sounds I trying sleep. Just love many things. Bought refurb, works new ones I bought prior! Came original packaging well! Love it. It's like second wife. So far impressed all. Does save groups correctly understand time I'm sure excitement about.

We mainly use verbally add things shopping list, occasionally use number &#34;fun&#34; things program do, like go Red Alert make TARDIS land (yes, we're house geeks... even chose wake-word &#34;Computer&#34; instead &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now need Majel Barret's voice I geek heaven.) ;)It's easy get Premium Spotify work properly it, still sure get multiple music accounts attached listen different music different rooms, far still worth it.

This product currently two related software flaws make completely unusable:1) There &#34;card&#34; homescreen called &#34;Things To Try&#34; -- ad Alexa services try. You turn homescreen cards, one.2) By default, homescreen cards &#34;cycle&#34; automatically, incredibly annoying.

Husband loves it! ***Love it*** Love Spot - Awesome little guy precise video - I’m saving buy one mom east coast - The Spot changes Everything far keeping loved ones connected!!!Well worth every Cent!! All fine Spot exact one massive failing. In order turn repeating alarm morning pretty much talk - thing usually want first woken bed partner definitely like. YES, manually swipe alarm face dismiss i) swiping rather touching screen half asleep difficult results setting snooze half time even really try swipe dismiss ii) manage swipe dismiss, completely delete recurring alarm.This especially annoying Amazon could easily fix simply making touching screen turn alarm NOT delete least make setting decide whether touching screen recurring alarm snoozes turns off. But clock year still adding setting, clearly going happen. This may biggest product design screw Amazon ever made. Excellent item returned repair ,receivded item back repair 07/23/18 . parts missing power cord included.please advise Awesome item I buy two! For awesome Echo Echo Dots are, Spot disappointment.

Let's say moment Alexa enters life, I turn around tell Siri get hell out. I love love love it. GREAT This first Alexa device fun discover ways use it. The biggest con \"drop-in\" feature, pretty creepy The best thing since sliced bread! Can’t used baby monitor I purchased it. I didn’t realize I read reviews Alexa skill syncing Nest Cam. Considering poor reviews fact simple fix, surprised Amazon hasn’t upgraded software allow 39 minutes viewing alerts like get Nest app. Would 5 stars could turn &#34;Things Try&#34; screen!!! I read buying Spot. Amazon, please update enable us turn off! It SO extremely annoying look see time instead see &#34;Things try&#34;. Love it. So great use!!! I 3 these... amazon ignoring customers using devices marketing tool. You customize screen contents, cannot turn advertising, Things Try... People suggest can, turn content changes acceptable option.Moreover, increase size slightly, improve audio speaker. That would give 5 star device.Right i’m debating whether return 3 devices. My wife says should. I never thought I going THAT person completely connected. I purchased another Echo product Prime Day fell love. I one office one kitchen. I already used morning briefings News I getting ready day well look recipes. The screen big enough easily read writing (this concern me). I loved much I purchased grandparents parents easily video call tend issues computer video conferencing tools. Note: I purchase camera covers (even though button &#34;turn camera microphone&#34; impede operations camera worried about, work around! LOVE love love this! I echo, several echo dots, love video clock. I longer wake say &#34;Alexa, time it?&#34; &#34;Alexa, weather&#34; I even watch videos forget kindle bed. After purchasing Echo Spot add 4 Amazon Echoes...I pleased Echo Spot...I use Arlo Security cameras Ring video doorbell works without problems... Disconnects often It much I knew I bought it. It pretty much runs house, helps fall asleep, takes care schedule, entertainment Love, love far. I received Thursday. I unwrapped it, set up, & immediately programmed it. No problem reoccurring things try. I set rotate shows time like I want. I love low ambient look night. This best Alexa enabled device get, versatile useful. It sound way better dot good regular echo. The screen makes difference world. I needed alarm clock fit bill perfectly. I believer amazon echo, Alexa fire. Great customization options Alexa always helpful. Sound quality also surprisingly good. You're going shell extra $20 bucks stand come angle best ever using this. My biggest gripe. I already spent arm leg come stand. Love except Amazon needs reference one cohesive link full user manual. I hours research websites. Plus, instruction Alexa skills would great. We often get answer, \"I know skill\" even though I've added app. I.e. Kwikset Pizza Hut. Such handy item night stand. She reads night gets set day morning calendar weather views.  I got Prime day figured I'd see hype about. Honestly I really want like personally bugging house seems kinda weird, honestly, I love it. Like way world going, not.I loved much I ordered 2. I get Show looks like came 1990's downright ugly. I interest watching anything devices anyway, Spot's screen bother - although clear.Alexa hear pretty much everywhere. My favorite part living room hooked bluetooth soundbar - I say play song I want will. I guess I could pick smartphone that, know much easier interact media using voice rather navigating multiple pages.The one thing I fan home screen cards really rotate much - also rotate playing music. I'd love display weather I listen music.The screen clear I also really enjoy Alexa able tell commute - great skill download tell traffic 5 different places (that program name) say alexa give traffic parents - tell best route time arrive current traffic. I programmed parents, fiances parents, work, work. So really works great.The one thing I actually preferred Dot Spot dot light different colors package notifications.. I seen Spot really much package notifications yet. The dot easy tell something delivered. I would recommend Amazon exactly Dot Spot - Dot lights colors - can't Spot ? The way command alexa get blue ring, make ring yellow package updated delivery.Overall great device I looking forward integrating home around. I'm already looking dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- = I become home owner instead renting I can't tinker thermostat I purchasing Nest road HVAC integration. The screen response time way better I expected. Sound quality good too, also it’s bright I turn screen option. I Dot another room ever hears better one responds. Love it! I LOOOOOOOVE thing! :) Watching movies bit disaster round screen, GREAT chachki toy :) We gave Echo Spot gift mother law. She loves it. She play music genres! Easy use. Very easy set up. Does said will. Very satisfied far.. Great product, need bit adjustment set spotify, time, weather, etc.. Hong Kong, works fine now. I used alarm clock + music bedroom, love it. I bought replace Dot bedroom. Already Show couple full-sized Echo units house.The Spot okay is. Two issues, one minor one major:-the minor one - include huge bezel front? Why take space make display larger? A total waste usable space.-the major one, also involves Show: I'm used devices. I need see &#34;Things Try&#34; whenever I use voice command (even setting rotate starts crap dare actually use devices). I'm child I need told hundred times play music it. And nightstand seeing highly annoying tips outrageous unit meant used next bed. Why Amazon fix give us option turn nonsense off? I want see clock face, period, silly nanny reminders. This product looks adorable room I love it. I recently bought mom one gift Prime Day can't wait use it. love spot Loving way google home devices. I've using couple months amazon prime subscriber value greater google. I'm using listen free music prime (better alternatives), audible even watch movies. The display little small lots watching, sound louder, YOUTUBE NEEDS TO BE AVAILABLE. These issues put 3.5 4 stars. Fix one (youtube) 5 star item. To alleviate sound I've paired blue tooth speaker. Right sits living area. Where I think shine office desk. Once great offers I could see purchasing additional nightstand Amazon Alexa items household. I felt happy adding house I felt stupid using google home. I like Alexa device small. What wonderful little Alexa enabled gadget like analog clock face best Love it, Love it, Love it!!!

The echo works fine get indundated &#34;Things try&#34;. I 10 year old needs stimulus tell things. I found way turn except .... turning screen. If I cannot find suitable fix goes back. Great wake music told weather. Bought replace Sony Dash (remember those?) Sony decided pull support entirely. It works great I use for: alarm clock, weather station, background music player voice control lights throughout house. My biggest gripe device I knocked star can't turn suggestions &#34;Things Try&#34;. It 's annoying stupid design decision since control turn things want see cycles content screens. A software update two would help improve especially full control want want see content rotation. Can't turn &#34;things try&#34; screen scroll. This big promotion device Amazon. Packing sending back. They really want get heads. Enough already. Love everything product I bought two one household one mother law video chat emergency it’s easy use older folks. This thing woke middle night saying “ready setup”. It already setup. Should simple thing check time asking. Wife happy... The echo spot really great. I got easy set up. I one problem. When advertise show screen time weather town. Sadly way make home screen. The home screen time😔. I spoke support wonderful lady tried researched 45 minutes avail. I disappointed I wanted screen time occasional screen rotate. I hoping something this. Other it’s great The product attractive somewhat useful, BUT, Amazon chose force users view “things try” Trending”. This greatly depreciates value product. Do buy unless willing view billboard Amazon. The Echo Spot really helped streamline day efficient! It reminds appointments, warns traffic snarls, tells weather every day suggesting new music introducing new artists.  Come - amaonmazing! It's way smart speaker. It's wake-up alarm, security blanket, infotainment center all-in-one. It's connection world night hours I'm mostly sleepy zonked-out Zzzzzzz... I still access world without reading-glasses late night. It sounds amazing size. It hear I'm far awake (mostly). As say, &#34;this must-have device&#34;. Yep, true statement. Got one son Prime Day. We love them! I want one every room, would excessive. In one word: Amazing! Best tech purchase I ever made controls devices house even pool! I’m leaving don’t enough attention span read instructions. You stop screen rotations.Swipe clock screenSelect settingsHome & clockHome cardsRotate onceProblem solved Very nicely constructed. My wife wanted second kitchen I order second one.  I love little gadget, replaces old clock basically, love listen music morning get weather updates, news briefs. Let's know amazon order arriving & delivered etc. Yes little pricey, purchased Amazon Prime Now Prime Day delivered day $99. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073SQYXTW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_18 I love little Echo Spot, I replaced older full size echo little guy. The round screen interesting choice I'm sure I like look growing me. The speakers could slightly louder solid echo product. It's good Siri, BUT still positives, great playing music, setting alarms. I personally felt I paid much product, nearly half prime day (literally day I purchased it). So I'm pretty disappointed. I might still return get money back. . Having received gift, I writing initial thoughts: (compared google home mini)PROS: Way easier setup google home mini. I able connect ALL smart home device (unlike google) without issues. Making phone calls clearer receiver understand me.CONS: Need enable 'skills' get functionality. Google home built functionality search web answer questions easier amazon echo. Could connect youtube. Love Well-made product.Echo Spot - White Installed back porch, works well! I get wall mount it, also works well. Thank God, alarm clock lcd gets dim enough sleep. I'm light sensitive sleeper wind taping black tape stuff bed room. Not guy. The Alexa features nice listening music night great. We enjoy falling asleep meditation podcasts though use skill anypod get podcasts like. Video kinda tiny useless size that's expected. Audio quality much better echo dot. I love thing. At first I thought wouldn’t stay clock I would suffer ads forever lights sits clock it’s comfortable eyes, easy set up. Love Got and, expected, ITS GREAT! Almost swell SHOW. Love thing. People think I’m crazy paying much glorified alarm clock. But I don’t care!! For me, waking good mood pretty important helps it!! So glad I don’t deal old EEAANH EEAANH EEAANH alarm. Very excited say “Alexa, turn lights” (smart plugs get soon!) Got camera privacy slide since bedroom. I absolutely love this! Very user friendly I got Kasa Cam go monitor living room. Super easy set operate. I wish actually came camera privacy cover pivoting stand buy separately. I’m looking forward future software updates different clock faces. I like digital I miss colon hours minutes them. I’d also like see celebs jump board alarm voices. I really complaints, I’m nit picky point. Worth every penny! Surprisingly good beefy sound thing. I think might shape one favorite echo devices. I nearly them. ;-) Given gift wife, compliment echo. She loves it. This gift. But I one love it. The words songs great I live face I chose clock. This favorite echo (unless I listening music). I’ve little 3 weeks I absolutely love it! It’s easy use. I’m basically using smart alarm way more. The screen quality great looks super cute sitting night stand. I don’t know I lived without long. If can’t decide whether buy not, GO FOR IT! You won’t regret it!! Fairly useless. Bought spot loved it. Within months started acting funny would stop working—called determined overheating. I told unplug technical support would call within 24-48 hours. Waited 48 hours without response replied email asked wait week. A week goes absolutely response I inline chat per instructions. Told wait longer. REALLY???? Unacceptable—expected Amazon. Find funny always thank Prime member issue arises I cannot even get assistance. Much easier use dot. It picks voice farther away speakers seem lot cleaner sounding The screen nice perk I use bed time listen prime shows bed, screen small watch shows..It displays alarm print I know Alexa heard correctly. make clock face personal pictures. My complaint add stand standard. I need spot desk definitely needed beside bed.Many people complain basic Alexa program still new tech I'm going split hairs. The echo good dot spot better dot. Alexa gets better time skills increasing weekly. Now Alexa even tells difference son voice. I think Amazon working overtime project. I gave feedback ask able self made lists make name lists anything.I used Alexa I talk even I'm staying hotel found. Alexa, time it? ALEXA???!! When buying another product option bundle one extra $30...so thought not? Well, I'm glad did! We really enjoying Echo Spot. It reads stories girls, plays music, gives us news, much more! It's responsive many skills enjoy. For size screen thing $25 This 1 6 echo devices house currently deployed bedside alarm clock. I use basically echo dot clock attached may occasionally pull camera video. Audio quality screen quality really appropriate music watching video. Much time works well alarm clock, serious flaws, particularly last one bed first wake. It doesn’t seem like engineers actually tested bedroom 2 people different schedules. Try walking dark bedroom sleeping wife waking saying “Alexa set alarm 5am” Alexa repeat “OK alarm set 5am.” Not good. I suppose could whisper fumble volume button stupid. Plain simple, device needs brought 1990’s simple touch screen interface added set alarm. I know cumbersome interface situations one set alarm alexa app phone. No thanks, I’m picking phone set alarm I use built alarm save step. At least engineers allow alarm turned touch screen, example wake minutes early cancel alarm without speaking waking spouse. The interface using touch screen cancel alarm gone however great. There separate snooze cancel buttons. Currently touch snoozes swipe cancels. It easy half awake snooze think cancelled. When snoozed alarm goes minutes later, amused longer sleeping wife let know summoning Alexa turn bathroom lights I’m shower. I bought mother loves it! I want get one now!  Invasive scared crap speaking spoken to! CREAPY AF 4 5 stars. I Original Tall Echo, 4 dots, 2 spots 1 Show. The thing I'm finding problem speakers Spot. using Drop In. Sometimes I'm heard spot vice versa. The voices tends break sound coming intermittent. The optical fine........ sound. Sometimes I'll repeat wake word 2-3 times I'm 8 feet away plus one $20 stands. I find ECHO DOT, Original echo Show much better sound quality. That's one reason I bought Echo Show. I bought 90 year old grandmother I love it!!! She call family members voice, play games, even watch video I love I “drop in” time see doing. She lives herself. And I feel comfortable emergency could call Alexa help!!  I love thing! It plays books audible prime music sets alarms! If you’re considering purchasing one, get it. It’s worth it. I think read mind Perfect Love spot! My favorite feature &#34;Alexa, start day.&#34; I love I hear weather, traffic even word day! It even goes right favorite podcast I get dressed! Works. Replaced expired bedside radio/alarm.It took realize option setting involved using touch screen.Maybe said something setup process. Works great I love it, grand daughter digs watching cartoons lol Gift husband. Great! I said I desired assistant I came across Spot! As Mom two things get hectic really quickly trying manage everyone’s schedules & own. I verbally tell Alexa reminder timer I need set Voila!Having Spot given virtual assistant I desired without actually hire someone. Not mention many awesome features. I Alexa synced Audible & Kindle & Alex read book libraries me.I’m still excited see else Spot do!Side note: I wanted purchase Show & probably still line however I sooooo love sleek little Sopt! I love product , disappointed I realized I longer play youtube videos. I'm past 30 days return date. I realizing I expensive alarm clock. I hoping youtube comes back. I looking buy echo show kitchen prime day. Glad I didn't. I’m sure Amazonia asking purchase. I got gift kids Mother’s Day... It bought account. Lil bit creepy 😑. I haven’t really much use one calls, text. So part meh. The things different Alexa products. I love love love love it! I feel like I talking computer tells EVERYTHING. Love Echo Show. Being able see lyrics songs play able put recipe screen wonderful!! It seems work well. Unfortunately lot functionality lost because, many mentioned, work google Youtube more. This problem caused Google came devices longer allow access devices like these. This even effected smart TV. Anyhow purchased communicate children grandchildren we'll see happens hand out. Love listening music. Still trying learn everything does. Very pleasedSimple figure I expected,already 2 shows Very good Excellent listen music, audio books, look cameras around house. Alexa fun! I’ve added smart home aspects, friend listens Spotify, husband enjoys interacting too. Tremendous way communicate friends family across country It,is,what some. Sounds great too. On,y thing I dont like camera seen anyone working amazon I asked echo show show camera didn’t know I saying knows turn camera can’t dhiw u what’s recording hmm Used personal use. We like hearing weather, news CNN, various playlists. Love it! I like echo show best! big screen watch movies preview movie alexa answer question name it. Prime day pricing good, show limited. No video services available except Amazon Video. No Netflix YouTube. Alexa limited also, nearly useful Google. works great, great picture easy setup use.. The fact help find phone I home alone worth price device I LOVE THIS ITEM... I UNDERESTIMATED THIS ITEM, I HAVE ANOTHER 2 IN MY CART ... BUT I'M WAITING FOR THE SAME DEAL AGAIN!!!, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM! I love using Echo Show music, sounds amazing! Unfortunately video quality video chatting isnt great, husband I video chat often video comes clear end says image pixelated. I'm still learning use far good. Love it!  Oh I love Echo Show video news spots Waste money echo generation 2. You don’t really get anything video chat device would FaceTime Skype cycle pictures put slideshow mode sticks first photo leave matter I even looked online research articles cannot find solution. I also problems device shutting I problems echo devices. Price difference worth No tube bought I known This second echo show. We home Mexico one USA. Now one us home easily stay touch see other. We also drop houses aren’t check them. We use turn lights security systems homes. We also echo dots various rooms. We love technology! We ask many questions plays music us. Needs play YouTube prime video maybe Netflix. But good sound We love Echo Show! Great product I love device. I upgraded Echo Spot. I wish I could customize clock screen analog, mimic I used echo spot. Also, better sound quality device. Love thing.. Best toy I've bought awhile.. So far I smart plug connected running Ac. And wifi light bulbs. Baseball scores, weather cool music best feature. This thing lot cooler I thought would be. I mostly used read audiobooks, I also love I see camera I'm work. I’m really enjoying product. Love flash briefing, timers, weather reports more. We love Show. It loses connection every sure Show issue internet issue. But overall use many applications. Works well optional cameras. Conferencing good. Still feel like Bezos spying me. I connect smart lights phone. And smart device. It's convenient I highly reccomend anyone disposable income. Love, love, LOVE!!! Love Echo products. I like video phone feature this. Can check cat vacation. Works exactly would expect, right box. I love able hear, see, I need device. I loved regular echo, Show much better! It works wonderfully music (especially paired Amazon music account) perfect ring doorbell. Love it! I absolutely LOVE this!!! I kitchen I use cooking. The speakers amazing!!! I've week far good. We enjoying it. Love product idea. Super easy set & get started, breeze routine tasks (set alarms, timers, add items shopping/to lists, play music, get news, anything supposed do). The sound good Imhave sitting, tinny found. There one thing I HATE & would keep recommending anyone - cannot delete nice screen continually running suggestions ask Alexa. Unless turn screen totally I I go bed. And bad bc like continuously running advertisement set-up guide. Not attractive. The echo show sale prior Prime day less Echo, I figured I getting great deal money trying decide device start with. Because ever present script nice device look at, I would buy again, recommend - go Echo. I may still exchange product. Very excited see This great music, video calling, kitchen timers, probably bunch more. The reason I gave 4 instead 5 stars ever-floating \"things try\" home screen. This purely aesthetic complaint, hopefully soon Amazon allows option shut off. I love idea star trek computer home. The skills great, natural language work mediocre. Got gift... cool! I view news, recipes shopping lists. And much more!!! I love it. Was easy set far, I wish little set instructions. There still whole lot I would like able I idea I it. But I really like it. This second one. I one kitchen wanted another home office.It amazing quick look I working. I live busy life helps keep track work personal appointments.I buy holiday gifts whole family. The gift organization information voice command away.  Don't waste money. I echo gen 1, echo gen 2 dot. They far better job voice recognition Echo Show. In fact, bad virtually useless. Also, speaker incredibly bass heavy....so much hard understand voices. I've worked adjust bass punch mids treble, still sounds awful. Finally, screen add much. I can't see across room, rarely activates meaningful way, doesn't, distraction help.(Using FaceTime much practicalthan using Show.) I'm surprised Amazon make little useful is. Perhaps future, now, waste time money. I love it. It everything. Thought would powerful lot functionality. Not much better Echo dot. Not worth money. I purchased echo 2 weeks ago , I love product, I would definitely recommend I'm loving new Echo Show. The video screen adds much value potential. Movies, tv shows, song lyrics, extra features available Echo Show. Oh, also built camera taking pics. My wife using Skype years talk parents daily, constant technical issues. Since father 88, lot ask man uninstall/reinstall/reconfigure Skype, does. When I saw sale, I jumped them. My wife resistant &#34;learn new technology&#34;, I told work - like video phones I saw New York World's Fair 1964 - 54 years ago!Yesterday set quickly worked fine, issues. My wife told co-worker today went bought 3 - one husband, one set parents. It works, like telephone - imagine that. Bluetooth sound great. Videos crazy. It’s amazing device. Great item knowledge, directions, music,laughter nice-needs work Very cool! Enjoy using it. Great sound. Love shopping list The Echo Show ok, however constant suggestions ask Alexa sooooo annoying way eliminate it. Also, I thought I could weather area displayed continuously, I talk Alexa, I want middle night. Had I payed full price would returned. There features nice, I may never use them. We held purchasing Echo resist Prime Days. The Echo works great nice screen. There still lot need learn do.  Love much, still learning everything Echo do, really enjoying whole process. Love it!! Still learning possibilities. I love echo show awesome speakers I love fact listen music words come around liking far. Also able read what's shopping list list notifications Nice works great Easy set sooooooo many things do. Just awesome! Met every expectation I I like Unit working great, true PIA products today shipped without user manuals. Do manufacturers truly believe user magically know full capabilities product purchased? I idea echo show's capabilities. I linked Hue lights, idea commands work, won't. I purchased Fire TV Stick along Show, idea maximize two. Just examples.I even purchased text users found helpful. Seems way basic me, better kick pants. It's fun item have. Has lot udefulness. Big negative use Google (or real search engine) get answers find information. I pleasantly surprised! It’s awesome far Alexa Show amazing. My wife hated I bought it, thought need day fell love Alexa lol. It convenient setting timers, listening music, playing music dog im home, connecting bluetooth speakers parties, playing movies. I love it! Do understand excitement alexa devices google ones either. It rarely gets I say correct, control Dish receiver. Yes I set correctly, using alexa app phone. We got 129, good deal, ti definately worth 229 price though. Maybe another month get better, either I one deaf dumb. Really recommend item current time It makes talking grandchildren easy, especially little ones. Outstanding product! Great product. I already purchased Echo couple Dots hesitated purchase price dropped. I glad I did. The versatility video screen outstanding. No regrets! I purchased \"Show \" keep touch daughter family recent move half way across country. It wonderful seeing faces conversations.

I really enjoy using it. I hooked one lights I tell Alexa I want off. also, connects Spotify I Alexa resume playlist pick right ended. I feel like there's even I this, I'm excited use more! Upgraded original Echo Prime Day far I love it. I'm sure I long way go maximize utility, I owe marked increase lyrical knowledge thing. Who knew Post Malone actually used words?! You can't access YouTube! Why consumer's pay argument! Why can't good product offers need?  Still learning Echo show far love it. My 9 year old loves cook especially Aunt lives state connect cook together. I love desk.

Hi resolution It easy use everything I hoped I love Echo Show. I’m going live campus school fall got two serve easy way connect. Some people might like camera makes little sense. We carry devices cameras time. The difference item stationary. My family I also find drop-in feature comfort rather invasion privacy. It’s definitely source relief parents easily pop onme visa versa.I’d also like thank Amazon including VoiceView screen reader device. The Show would lot less blind friendly, even Alexa present, hadn’t included that.We echo-loving household two dots, three echos, two Shows. I wouldn’t surprised got future loved ones. Thanks, Amazon! I love awesome Very Good able listen Every single song time Amazon's vast library. We're beginning know everything Echo Show offer. Well worth price!! Alexa helpful. Love it!

I agree ...YouTube there. We like lot, sound better original echo, bass feels deeper. The screen cool, though, havent got lot use though. Good sound! The capacity join different apps make work smart home Great addition Alexa family, wish could use screen backgrounds. Don't get wrong I regret buying especially primeday sale $100 sale price skills show lacking. I've previous experience echo Dot blows previous expectations water!It's great since play videos music multiple sources speakers pretty loud. Love echo show, keep I video chat kids grandkids. I kitchen, I run something I Alexa add grocery list. I use everything. Was easy set I’m really hoping skills take advantage shows touch screen. There’s incredible amount untapped potential locked behind restrictions. Make use best part show enable skills navigate touch please! Love l. I plan getting echo kitchen. It pick voice unless I yell times. great love Amazing! Fire HD much more. Over priced pair speakers. Seems good product but, unable play music sync Sonos system. Sonos seem recognize all. Great product. Like apps I connect it. I love able talk grandson ease picture quality great Love it! Easy setup I ‘Drop in’ daughter son-in-law live St. Louis anytime. Everyone loves mother drop in, right 😎 Fun I use control smart home. Show great. Still learning do, able watch videos, talk face face others features. Wish I bought one work Very intrusive, I turn Love echo show Works well. Not thrilled apps paid seprately. Video calls Mom Love able see, well hear things. Sound better, too! I love Just like echo. Doesn’t disappoint Nice picture good sound mics sensitive dot, dots hear across house Show not, said I LOVE show!!I watch TV movies tg ed kitchen, News playing Music....love....it !! I basically use play music tell news..its sometimes hard communicate it, dont say command correctly, realize learning style speaking commands even though dont say exactly should.  Upgraded echo echo show. I love Echo Show!! I dot using last 6 months, Show much better. The sound quality amazing screen resolution like watching mini 4K tv. I love able see timers, events list instead read me. I purchased prime day, worth every penny. When dot given me, I thought \"this cute novelty, I'll probably never use it\". Was I wrong!! Echo part daily routine, made life much easier. So far I’m pleased Echo Show. The problem is, there’s much I haven’t able explore extent abilities! I got special price part Prime Day promotion...and can’t beat get price. Very pleased sound. The video screen sharp. Sometimes takes tries get Alexa perform command...but I get know system better, I’m hoping improve. One drawback music...I’ve noticed lot songs years past, re-recordings original artist...but original recording itself. Example: Secret Agent Man Johnny Rivers...a “live”version used, original version. If I’m going pay Prime Music...I’d like hear original version songs...not later recordings. Or least give choice I want hear. Otherwise, I pleased Echo Show. So pleased fact, I bought second one! I like everything, ! Im still learning use it! It's like another kid house; I constantly repeat myself.I tell Alexa something clear day, according history, hears something comeletely different.The device really cool, I like concept, gets two stars. However, work intended.I find irritated often I use device. Really easy use It's great sound video quality The way music sounds poor quality It everything Echo does, more. Although I probably use video functions. I hoped display would allow customization. It limited. I would like clock weather display large text time, displays small text. It also always line says &#34;Tell Alexa this, that&#34;, tips bottom screen. I would like see go away, won't. Sound quality good, good big Echo, good enough. I bought sale think I got value I paid. I would disappointment I paid full price. Love echo show! I enjoy thing. Its learning Am happy see. All echo devices stopped communicating properly Sonos devices upon connecting echo show account. Asking echo device play music Sonos baffled system previously worked flawlessly. This went two weeks I eventually solved problem neither Amazon Sonos could figure out. So far, I like it. It better I expecting it. Doesn't always respond wake word. This 3rd echo product I say I A little disappointed. Alexa voice assistant great comes controlling connected home lot learn google assistant comes getting answers search queries. Good product. After two weeks I sure I like ever present Alexa screen well. I bought abay monitor combined wifi camera, works. But screen always unless tell turn - instead talking cylinder mini screen talks also writes everything says shows accompanying video. There something audio made Alexa different, I ways TV talk to. It f****** sucks  Love able read lyrics favorite songs. This thing awesome grocery lists, paired AnyList app. The flash briefing good too. My complaint pause something, Alexa decides longer want listen thing. Forever. All all, definitely worth purchase. Works great, video call function nice communicating drop-in  As see Echo Show kitchen. It far exceeds expectation. There’s wealth information topic. If customizable sound video. I also Echo Echo Dot. You group hole house music. Still done exploring love it. Perfect getting recipes see you’re preparing cook. Fairly easy use Absolutely LOVE Echo Show! It awesome works great Ring Video Spotlight Cams! Music demand many features I yet explore!!! Absolutely love it! I use everything!I tell friends clients it’s daughter I never had.

Very convenient look recipes, listen news, watch prime video I'm cooking Always wanted one,till I got one, cracked be, hard navigate I actually like dot better.

I show long used lot, I love it! I use set timers cooking stove finicky wanting work time. I also use check different recipes, listen music time favorite.... telling everyone time dinner. My son gets real kick that!I know lot people expecting shows possible moment, remember original echo first came out.

So bit worried use again. That needs fixed.I say I happy Echo Show! I long. It's first Alexa thing. I sure like I done far lot learn play Works great fun use. This best echo devices I spot dot echo Having large screen really majes enjoyable experience. Only thing it’s missing youtube. easy use. I bought go security camera system, perform like I thought would. It alert us someone door. Also, I can't talk person door echo show, cell phone. Great device, features awesome, interaction fantastic. Home automation works perfect link accounts correctly. My issue (4) Echo Shows (2) sent repair screen glitching!! These less 3 months old already issues!First repairs sent “updated firmware” I got device back nothing worked, I update newest firmware work again. Then (2) weeks later glitch starts again!I love show I’m getting really frustrated glitching. Super fun !! I ty I expecting  I love much!! Alexa even better show things! I echo got 2 show. 1 Daughter. Absolutely love it. Especially video chat. I've Alexa Dot time I'm really enjoying Alexa Show. It's great visual whether song weather. Played Jeapordy, I'm good it. You learn trivia one's watching! Love recipes visible movies available. Haven't long enough try everything. Got Amazon prime ring pro. Work really great. Being lazy guy I I need go see door anymore I'm gaming. We originally got Show video chat family members, works great that. We found really like checking things hands-free like weather recipes. So far really liked Show, would recommend it! Easy setup. Was running minutes. The learning feature outstanding. Now I know Amazon far ahead competition. I bought product hoping Alexa would pretty well developed far enough along, therefore expecting responsive. This $100 piece crap doesnt even know respond question amazon told ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device potential given big screen, decent sound 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh lastly, device pretty useless without prime membership. I linked personal account thing literally decorated bluetooth speaker. I went family account (this one) got work minimal. Oh, even prime membership, music pass something that's extra 3.99 month, leaving item subscription nightmare, overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker eyes. I would give zero stars I could. quite nice...clear, great sound. Versatile use, watch movies news. Able use remote vehicle. Or use communication hub home. Great produc!!! I bought two. One one daughter lives another state. We love it!! Our family bought several help communicate older parents grandparents need simpler devices full-fledged tablet. What fantastic potential - digital photo screen, video calls, easy accesss music, audio books, etc. However, setup, discovered huge lurking negative. Amazon forces view continous spam home screen promoting Alexa features. You turn many things settins, cannot turn &#34;Things Try&#34;. Instead beautiful digital photo screen weather time ... constantly spam ad across home screen says, &#34;Try ......&#34;. AMAZON, please listen customers offer setting turn SPAM! The best part owning mother anti-technology uses ease everyday finds new reasons use well. Well done. It’s second one, I put one kitchen recipes. Echo Show perfect staging kitchen recipes right there. No need print them. Wonderful device. Acoustical sounds powerful tall cylindercal echo covered adjacent family room. Great fun frustrating times. Commands tv show get mixed (asking watch something turn directv, display show stinks 8 year old) Also would like video options flash briefings. Still really tech wonder low price. Love play music see lyrics. Connected echo dot I enjoy listening multiple rooms. I love Alexa I chance add Show home... I jumped it. But... I'm member Show know I paid extras Echo (now upstairs bedroom. If I supposed pay Show added home, I'm afraid ask &#34;What's point?&#34; Purchased &#34;personal&#34; contact vehicle engaging long distance grandchildren. Works perfectly every regard. Resolution sound better expected. Highly recommend. Works well, pictures awesome! Sound could better. Must bandwidth Alexa devices whole home music. 2.4ghz vs 5ghz.

Mic hears everything understands half first time, often takes multiple tries gives correct result. Nice add home.What I like limitations, example world soccer. It give much info sport teams American. I little apprehensive buying I saw reviews saying sounds like crap. I'm audiophile means maybe that, I think sounds great considering size. It fills living room sound gets pretty loud remaining clear. I issues pairing devices utilizing voice commands. I paired EcoBee3, Firestick, Phillip's Hue light bulb. I plan adding devices I go.

Speakers great fun play music voice command! I tec smart enough make work all. Will send back I cant get help. My eco dot works fine. complacated.I wanted bigger speaker. We long time Amazon Prime family, many years, new Alexa world thought purchase Alexa Plus, hub, included Phillips Hue light bulb would great start. Alexa lot good things us like Alarm morning, verbalize books, playing music command, even linked Sirrius/xm account. Good daily stuff. Good sound, Bose. But, ads say &#34;Hub included&#34; need anything else operate devices. Well, so. I understand differences product device support. The fact came Hue light bulb works /off/ dimming bulb. The bulb capable much Hue App Hue app recognize Alexa hub bridge. So, appears get Philips bridge set bulbs scenes, time lights away, set color tones, etc. That done via internet phone tablet away home. The list goes capabilities without bridge. Was disappointed find fact, point I feel misled Amazon included Hue bulbs without explanation. Maybe throw good discount way get Hue bridge I keep Echo Plus I invest light bulbs.  I love play well Amazon Prime... many shortcomings potential fees Item described delivered time. Thank I bought 2 (plus 2 Echo Dot 2nd Generation) Prime Days. Love Echo Plus easy setup. The reason 4 star fact one arrive free Philips Hue White A19 Single LED Bulb Works Amazon Alexa. There one call find why. Product not. Light bar never went orange. I googled reset instructions actually differ package instructions. I tried both. Product defective Exactly I wanted speedy shipping.....thank much! Easy install I original Echo really like it. I wanted another one basement. I realize huge stereo settings sound bad all. Definitely take much room. Great price Echo Plus Prime Day. I ordered two!! I bought prime day saved lots.I 3 large blue tooth speakers house I used years, echo plus louder 3 combined time. Very impressed clarity volume.You need paid subscription form steaming audio. That’s sad fact. It’ll play pandora Spotify it’s limited skips song selection without subscriptionDoes stream YouTube music YouTube audioApple users disappointed see it’s convenient apple deviceOverall, I still loved device I’ll getting DOT audio jack (as echo plus) connect external speakers I thinking getting long time excited arrived bundled Philip Hue bulb. The excited ended quickly. I spend total 4 hours attempting add bulb Alexa Echo Plus. Everything I tried, ended Discovery Failed message. I tried set again. I watched YouTube videos. I read set websites. I poster child insanity (doing thing expecting different results).The next day I went onto Amazon get tech support. I hoping something would done make thing work, also problem operator error. Well 3 tech support staff 1 hr. 19 mins. phone, still work. This product tested patience. So far experience shifting mindset going smart home kicking old school.The reason I gave two stars Amazon sending different Echo Plus light bulb. The problem bulb, packing items, I purchased another bulb still Alexa locate device.I pray next attempt successful I revise rating, odds I shipped defective Echo? The support person thought. Maybe I exploring Google device I can't get look hub. It looks like defuser.I can't believe I find YouTube videos show problems I did. Everything looked simple seamless...NOT experience I had. OK, I'm done review I spend enough wasted time weekend already. Got pretty good deal prime day event. It sounds pretty good works well far. nice take space I'm original purchaser Echo came limited test phase I've always loved it. I expanded Alexa usage adding Echo Dots around house finally decided jump buy Echo Plus. Let tell what, GREAT choice! As much I love original Echo, Plus obvious upgrade immediately noticeable. The sound great. And fact got built hub Philips Hue lights huge plus! received wrong product...was excited install ...all excitement gone. Thank Amazon. I’m trouble it, alarm times doesn’t work, timer doesn’t ends... Alexa keeps saying unavailable. Love wish I could play amazon music devices without buy additional subscription Sounds little better original plus interrogated Zigbee hub. The hub compatible GE Link bulbs. I got try side side Echo originale. They essentially dimension, weight woofer save smaller tweeter point instead built hub. As many folks already pointed out, hub direct replacement Philips Hue, Z wave anything else. It provides sub set features available stand alone hub ended losing functionality took granted dedicated hub. For me, voice recognition music play capability same, original Echo may edge volume department due larger speakers. The new Echo plus priced lower original Echo built hub I really need hub less functionality. In addition, I think Amazon software updates hub dedicated hub would bugs could end never fixed. My Philips hub gets software update probably every couple months keeps changes new bulbs FW fixes bugs. Net net me, Echo anything original Echo sound quality good. With original Echo available refurbished I would check first considering new Echo clearly inferior these. Why need buy $100 hub get work Samsung TV's many devices? I want money back! This thing even turn TV unless I buy another hub. What's point hub support half devices there? DON'T buy thing unless want spend another $100 another hub. It work many devices. Just Echo Dot must this. Better yet, get Google device. They actually understand talk. I love it, living room Absolutely love it.. thing would make better rechargeable. When playing music Bluetooth speaker outside I go inside change songs. I purchase echo plus built hub came free philips hue bulb. When I got everything set up, I realized echo plus hub won’t allow full functionality bulb. All turn light on/off dim. It change colors. You still Hue Bridge full function features bulb. I wish I’d bought bulb bridge separately use echo I already since built hub echo essentially useless I’ll buy hue bridge get full benefit lights. At volume setting half less, speaker sounds like something rattling, crackling vibrating it. I'd understand volume set higher. All speakers get distorted over-driven. But sound like over-driven case; sounds like rattle/crackle. Possibly bass high. Learned ability adjust sound characteristics (other volume). I attempt exchange assuming isolated problem. Sound fantastic Classic music. like orchestra home. control sound screamig twist top, also tell &#34;Alexa volume 3&#34; love Alexa, makes fun people around seeing first time I suppose get “free” lightbulb purchase. It come Echo. Upon reading carefully, says click box receive free bulb. 😳 course I want free bulb, wouldn’t? Just sneaky way get give many “ free” bulbs away. Disappointed! I yet set echo, first purchase alexia device. Debating want keep it. It come quickly prime membership. I bought didn’t realize plugged work. It isn’t convenient make always connect wall. It should’ve clear bought it.  Alexa helps lights music, helps kids think know everything know nothing lol Sweet love much I purchased 2, Alexa great purchase uncle lives himself, I got wasnt keen it, best friend, tells goodmorning say back along description something happening today something special happened years ago day, well sang Happy birthday lolol educated self things never knew, laughs things may say waits see response something hes asked love it, think I going hate it. Incredible piece technology.I right center living room island kitchen counter. The mic speaker goes every direction quality sound quite good. I connected Echo via Bluetooth Sony soundbar TV find Echo placement 360 sound appealing. It's audiophile equipment good range decent bass. The sound adequate indoor entertaining loud enough bother neighbors building. The knob top works great adjusting volume. This first Echo device I would imagine press volume buttons (on Echo 2) large inconvenience precise. For alone I would recommend regular Echo (2nd generation).The piece looks quality quite sturdy weight it. The rubber material bottom good grip granite counter-- cat even rub scent without tipping over.This order came free Philips Hue Bulb I installed along extra one I bought. I put 2 bulbs living room floor lamp, turned light, I say &#34;Alexa, connect devices&#34;. The default names bulb assigned &#34;First light&#34; &#34;Second light&#34;, I dimmer floor lamp I turned on/off one lights saying &#34;Alexa, turn second light&#34;. In Alexa app, I created 'Group' &#34;First light&#34; &#34;Second light&#34; named group &#34;The light&#34;, turn lamp bulbs shining I say &#34;Alexa, turn The light&#34;.I surprised easily bulbs connected Echo Plus built hub. I thought I would buy hub bridge connect floor lamp power plug. Apparently technology built directly inside bulb! I surprised that. Awesome.You feel like Tony Stark device. I added quite &#34;Skills&#34; like 'Thunderstorm sounds' 'Quote day' . Alexa always loads quickly. Adding songs hear specific playlists Amazon Music also great feature.I go second day ownership.I lucky buy $100 Prime Day, I think $150 pretty expensive considering Echo 2 $100. In opinion, paying premium Echo Plus decide value you:1) Taller 360 sound unit.2) Volume knob top spin (I think huge benefit buttons)3) Built hub Hue bulbs. After researching more, cons setup plan advanced light setups. For floor lamp, perfect.I highly recommend buy Echo dot bedroom now. Easy Install. Very clear speaker. I took one star delivered late OnTrac-like usual. Love, Love, Love  Good product. I would like tell I reason hate like speakers suck, color, shape even way smells, I honestly say number reason I hate device I tried set 3x's avail, I 4 Echo devices already I set use quite regularly, I reset phone (Galaxy S8), checked app updates, I cycled power Echo unit attempt. I work network/technology industry living 20 years now, lack experience knowledge problem here. I used app device even tells connected follow app continue set up, set screen continues roll 3 dots around screen 5 minutes app locks phone I force app close, restart phone Echo try again. I figured 3x's enough, hard techie, I imagine bad prove people clue technology....I hope call I'll tell em send product back! Pretty cool device. Still lot learn, I'm changing channels Fios, getting info needed. speaker great I needed for, mainly music. Unit came wrong plug, send back Amazon. Love It The sound quality really quite good.

Exchange new color Alexa best smart speaker I'm glad I came across sound amazing I mostly use Amazon Alexa music school work help I love control room lights color totally recommend It get sale 2 days ... CHECK EVENTS BEFORE U BUY THESE AMAZON PRODUCTS!  Pros- plenty loud large room high ceilings.Cons - hub doesn’t anything. It doesn’t work z wave (as states), doesn’t take voice commands SmartThings, I buy since hub doesn’t work z wave.It also sounds muffled way control EQ. (Not sure models, Dots clear.For money, buy echo dot echo (2nd generation). The echo dot takes voice commands smart things hub, go figure, audio clear. The dot also seems hear voice better almost whisper. Alexa decent speaker that's need. She terrible things. She consistently answers questions asked says &#34;hmmm I know that&#34; everything else. We've gone back using phones can't really look anything up. Pretty much everyone makes fun spending money I awesome Bose bluetooth already. I bought mother (who lives alone) uses lot happy it, full house kids I'm less impressed. I'd never recommend anyone except senior citizens love alone need able shout help event fall.

Then echo dot downstairs starting singing “oh technology oh technology” kind weird seems mind own. Love, Love, Love Amazon Echo Plus!!❤️❤️ The sound quality good, especially price pay this. I would recommend get Echo Dot buy better speaker instead. Maybe Sonos use Echo dot. Alexa able call phone I couldn’t find also turned light commanded. Then I came home day later wouldn’t turn light would shut off. Then said I devices; couldn’t find phone. Now working again. We see. Love selection music! I returning piece garbage soon possible. With lifetime Amazon spending approaching nearly $40,000, I’m sure I’m small customer them, I’ve rarely disappointed hundreds thousands Amazon purchases.I 8+ echos home automation bought Echo Plus specifically built-in hub along approximately $600+ zigbee light switches. The voice control subpar even works, rarity. Most often nothing. I could disappointed product strongly discourage investing Amazon/Zigbee ecosystem. If value money, expect working product need look elsewhere  I love Alexa, works great little children. She understand speak clearly. She fun Holy sound quality batman! This thing jams.

Wish volume capable going louder I love Best purchase year. I love these, I 2 dots one echo. For medium size rooms loud enough without external speakers although I use external dots. I really love dots! So awesome it’s connects rooms. But like you’ve read reviews definitely lower volume. Which I’m sure I connected speaker another device would great. But stand alone volume ok.

Love The ease installing Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet. For price, product nice quality nice features. So definitely complaints there. The reason I gave 3 stars echo dot I thought going may buyer error. First, I didn’t know product plugged times work. So I really don’t like it’s stand alone device. Also, speaker loud buying Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure echo dot lot I haven’t quite figured use fully kind seems like unnecessary device own, plus setting awful. I would definitely save money buy nicer one actually “Alexa”. I love product far things I it...such set timer, reminder, play music games. I like get full enjoyment purchase many things. It also difficult set up. The directions made sound simple one, two, three forgot step four, five six. I almost ready send back.The app extremely slow took hours get thing set up. However depending going using I think ok item. Love echo dot it’s amaxing!!! I like use listening podcasts. I like set greeting morning tell what's new. The one thing I like getting recognize radio station I wanted listen to. I finally got working, work bugs. Just like big sister, Echo, smaller, slightly less audio fidelity, much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used another room add Alexa additional room.

The speaker isn’t great reason lot times I play music start make weird noise stop. My son google home much better Not impressed I really like . takes learn uses I'm still learning! Alexa phenomenal! When think really doesn’t much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally able hook thermostat. I see price dropping like rock. The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker compound size, however projects good sound. It also port connect external speaker greater projection sound. I also like size awkward, take lot space. It works great Alexa App. I also think size great college students live dorm rooms small limited spacing. I use echo dot several different ways home. I use downstairs control lighting.

Or playing song quiz friends. Second dot. Son loves it. I love compact is. This worked well 6 months stopped connecting internet (wifi) none trouble shooting efforts worked. Amazon customer service help told warranty 3 months, disappointing, willing replace. It talks me, plays type music want listen to, even turns I ask to. Ask play Motown radio Pandora keeps asking I want add salsa station. Motown isn’t close salsa phonetically. Love it, still learning capabilities, lot fun. Easy set up. Still trying get connect light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex cool! I love it! I use everything. It’s part daily routine The Alexa program great, quality best. It could definitely louder. Overall I like this. Though Siri phone I need I don’t “smart home” don’t intend make one. But it’s fun I use music read audible books. Alexa pretty basic almost like toy. Shouldn't released market without proper development. Speech recognition fails understand basic American British Accent.The music play restrictive. Speech refined way understand (almost a) human speaking. Linking Youtube via amazon web services work. Set easy. Love I'm amazed alarm. I tell Alexa wake particular song does. I love play list music. Not sure keep prime music still available. However love fact Amazon gave music free 3 months...they given prime free 3 months well. I love things do. I play learn it.

The sound quality wasn’t great, inexpensive Works great... bought shop like intercom house. It isn’t bad is. Have issues actually playing I want. Getting use iHeartRadio properly playing station I want challenge it’s bad sale price I paid. It’s great sound quality low I love it. As Always, easy set It works OK. This speaker quality much better iPhone X. I would spend extra money get full-size echo great sound quality. Very intelligent, love songs .... Review I love Echo Dot! The price I paid Prime Day comparable buying new digital clock bells whistles, much more. I play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on. Definitely worth money. Sound terrible. Cannot pair echo play simultaneously. Must upgrade amazon music want play one device time. Easy installation set up. Better sound Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified purchase. I spoiled one downstairs...so got one upstairs listen music , etc. I walked treadmill.  The commands Alexa requires specific. I find Google home much flexible figuring I'm asking for. HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND I real difficulty working Echo Dot. Alexi smart. 9 10 questions I asked I get &#34;I'm sure&#34; Half time I still asking question Alexi saying &#34;I'm sure&#34;.

I got boyfriend birthday kids blast asking Alexa kinds questions tell silly jokes. We love it. Better sound. Got 2nd Echo house, I already regular Echo. The Echo Dot easy set sound enjoyable, wishing I would gone another regular Echo solely based sound. I really happy original echo thought I'd get echo dot use bedroom. I really disappointed audio quality I connected external speaker via bluetooth. The audio much better I started problems loosing connection wifi, presumably due interference bluetooth. Then I connected speaker via auxiliary jack. that, auxiliary jack picked interference wifi I woken middle night horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon take thing back give good deal echo spot I hope better nightstand device. Listens well, way expected, love her! We still testing one far, like it. I hesitant putting voice activated device home would first. Unfortunately, sometimes gets WiFi light bulbs mixed turn we've able manage fix it. I mean, convenient, especially unable reach turn lights electronics could hook Dot. I like plays music reminders, alarms, etc - I'm still getting used fact The Man always listening now. Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions. Small convenient dependable. This dot cutie Alexa job ask.My issue fidelity expected small speaker Alexa perfect people like living alone.

We Amazon music listen music, check weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We still learning I tell you, absolutely amazing.

Entering Wi-Fi password site that’s vetted location app askes good thing. Try stay devices work directly Alexa hub third-party app, Amazon control types devices sensitive information handled. Great product Very helpful playing music, setting alarms, talking lonely. Easy set up, control Kasa smart plugs problem. Even kids figured stuff I would asked Alexa, like telling jokes singing. The Alexa app controls custom spark plug cloud cam. I love Alexa around house. My favorite features timers, alarms, music. Especially library sleep sounds. I got product gift kids, love too.

Love The ease installing Un excelente equipo inteligente al estar conectado al internet nos provee de múltiples funciones tales como, el tiempo,hora,información de cualquier estudio que estés realizando atrás vez del internet. For price, product nice quality nice features. So definitely complaints there. The reason I gave 3 stars echo dot I thought going may buyer error. First, I didn’t know product plugged times work. So I really don’t like it’s stand alone device. Also, speaker loud buying Bluetooth speaker, don’t. Lastly, I’m sure echo dot lot I haven’t quite figured use fully kind seems like unnecessary device own, plus setting awful. I would definitely save money buy nicer one actually “Alexa”. I love product far things I it...such set timer, reminder, play music games. I like get full enjoyment purchase many things. It also difficult set up. The directions made sound simple one, two, three forgot step four, five six. I almost ready send back.The app extremely slow took hours get thing set up. However depending going using I think ok item. Love echo dot it’s amaxing!!! I like use listening podcasts. I like set greeting morning tell what's new. The one thing I like getting recognize radio station I wanted listen to. I finally got working, work bugs.

When think really doesn’t much. Play music, answer stupid questions, finally able hook thermostat. I see price dropping like rock. The Echo Dot (2nd Generation) Smart Speaker compound size, however projects good sound. It also port connect external speaker greater projection sound. I also like size awkward, take lot space. It works great Alexa App. I also think size great college students live dorm rooms small limited spacing. I use echo dot several different ways home. I use downstairs control lighting.

Still trying get connect light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex cool! I love it! I use everything. It’s part daily routine The Alexa program great, quality best. It could definitely louder. Overall I like this. Though Siri phone I need I don’t “smart home” don’t intend make one. But it’s fun I use music read audible books. Alexa pretty basic almost like toy. Shouldn't released market without proper development. Speech recognition fails understand basic American British Accent.The music play restrictive. Speech refined way understand (almost a) human speaking. Linking Youtube via amazon web services work. Set easy. Love I'm amazed alarm. I tell Alexa wake particular song does. I love play list music. Not sure keep prime music still available. However love fact Amazon gave music free 3 months...they given prime free 3 months well. I love things do. I play learn it.

Getting use iHeartRadio properly playing station I want challenge it’s bad sale price I paid. It’s great sound quality low I love it. As Always, easy set It works OK. This speaker quality much better iPhone X. I would spend extra money get full-size echo great sound quality. Very intelligent, love songs .... Review I love Echo Dot! The price I paid Prime Day comparable buying new digital clock bells whistles, much more. I play music, set alarms, call friends, play games, set timers...the list goes on. Definitely worth money. Sound terrible. Cannot pair echo play simultaneously. Must upgrade amazon music want play one device time. Easy installation set up. Better sound Echo Dot Smart speaker. Very satisified purchase. I spoiled one downstairs...so got one upstairs listen music , etc. I walked treadmill.  The commands Alexa requires specific. I find Google home much flexible figuring I'm asking for. HANDY AS HELL 10/10 RECOMMEND I real difficulty working Echo Dot. Alexi smart. 9 10 questions I asked I get &#34;I'm sure&#34; Half time I still asking question Alexi saying &#34;I'm sure&#34;. The music great works well that. All All far frustrating experience. We still discovery phase, far enjoying smart home features installed. Totally gets sense humour We put one bedroom.

I got boyfriend birthday kids blast asking Alexa kinds questions tell silly jokes. We love it. Better sound. Got 2nd Echo house, I already regular Echo. The Echo Dot easy set sound enjoyable, wishing I would gone another regular Echo solely based sound. I really happy original echo thought I'd get echo dot use bedroom. I really disappointed audio quality I connected external speaker via bluetooth. The audio much better I started problems loosing connection wifi, presumably due interference bluetooth. Then I connected speaker via auxiliary jack. that, auxiliary jack picked interference wifi I woken middle night horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon take thing back give good deal echo spot I hope better nightstand device. Listens well, way expected, love her! We still testing one far, like it. I hesitant putting voice activated device home would first. Unfortunately, sometimes gets WiFi light bulbs mixed turn we've able manage fix it. I mean, convenient, especially unable reach turn lights electronics could hook Dot. I like plays music reminders, alarms, etc - I'm still getting used fact The Man always listening now. Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions. Small convenient dependable. This dot cutie Alexa job ask.My issue fidelity expected small speaker Alexa perfect people like living alone.
